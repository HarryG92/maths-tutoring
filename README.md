# maths-tutoring
Various worksheets and resources I have created for maths tutoring.

Sometimes I have taught the same topic multiple times to different students with
different emphases (e.g., Fourier analysis to maths students and to engineering
students), so there are multiple versions, at different levels and with
different approaches).

The sheets are grouped by general topic, but otherwise not presented in any
particular order. They are primarily intended for my personal use in tutoring,
but are available to any else who might gain some benefit from them.
