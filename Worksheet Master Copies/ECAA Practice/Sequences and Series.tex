\begin{enumerate}
	\item Write down the binomial expansion of $(a+1)^n$ for positive integer $n$. Hence show that
		\[\sum_{i=0}^n {n\choose i} =2^n.\]
	\item Find the coefficient of $\sqrt{5}$ in $(3-\sqrt{5})^4$.
	\item The coefficient of $x^3$ in $(2x-3p)^9$ is $\frac{21}{2}$. Find the value of $p$.
	\item The coefficient of $t^8$ in $(t+2)^n$ is 18. Find the value of $n$.
	\item In a geometric sequence, the first term is 1, the third term is the sum of the first two terms, and the sum to infinity exists. Find the sum to infinity of the sequence.
	\item In a geometric sequence, the sum to infinity is $k$ times the first term. Find the common ratio, in terms of $k$.
	\item There is a geometric progression $a_0, a_1,\hdots$ such that, in the standard `A' series of paper sizes, A$n$ paper is a rectangle of length $a_n$ and width $a_{n+1}$. The area of A$n$ paper is twice the area of A$(n+1)$ paper (because two sheets of A$(n+1)$ paper can be placed side-by-side to form one sheet of A$n$ paper). The area of an A0 sheet of paper is $1\mathrm{m}^2$. Find the length and width of an A0 piece of paper.
	\item An arithmetic series has $n$ terms, with first term $a$, common difference $d$, and sum $S$. A second arithmetic series also has $n$ terms, with common difference $d-2$ and sum $S$. What is the first term of this second series?
